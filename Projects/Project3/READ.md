This program will remove spaces from file names and replace them with underscores ( _ ). Please have a directory like ->( C:\Test\Test 1.txt )<- created
to test this program. There should be test files within the C:\Test directory. These files can be named anything however they will need a space
in the name to run. For instance file 1.txt or any word.txt 

To run the program run download the Project3Final.py file. Then run the file in your desired method. I prefer to use 
Visual Studio code and run the program in the terminal via right clicking the workspace. 
Once the GUI pops up enter in the directory you would like to alter the files in into the Red box. -> In my example I used C:\Test\Test 1.txt 
(DELETE THE TEXT IN THE RED BOX) When ready to run the program select the button to run it.
